# Angular Signals Course

Welcome to the **Angular Signals Course**! This course is designed to help you understand and work with Angular Signals, a powerful feature for managing state and change detection in Angular applications.

## Course Structure

The lessons of the course are organized in the `src/app` directory, with each lesson in its own folder. The folders are numbered sequentially (e.g., `00`, `01`, `02`) to indicate the order in which they should be explored.

Below is the structure of the course:
