## üîç Comparative Overview of Angular Signal Primitives

To deepen your understanding of Angular's reactive primitives, we offer a detailed comparative guide covering the core Signals API and experimental extensions. This guide explains their reactivity granularity, mutation capabilities, execution timing, typical use cases, and maturity status.

You can explore this comprehensive comparison and technical explanations in the markdown file:
